Themes of the setting:
-The threats to the people and societies of the area come from mortal hands for the most part.
-Magic traditions vary, with the more scholarly wizard types in larger empires while sorcerers are the main source in city-states and outside of cities with institutes of magical learning.
-Sellswords and mercenaries are common and range from caravan guards to bandit killers to hardened professional soldiers.
-Civilization exists primarily near rivers, oceans, or areas of fresh water or good rainfall. Between these pockets of cities and farmland is the domain of nomads and merchant caravans along with hardy towns built near oasis or other fresh water supplies.
-Humanity in the region is diverse and culturally flourishing. Generally the major cities and trade hubs are cosmpolitan, though the further one goes away from them the more provincial the area becomes.
-The other ancestries also exist in the region, though to a greater or lesser extent depending on the region. This is to be determined.
-This ties into the other 'setting' of the world mostly via trade and diplomacy. The Great Confederation of Uldrath exists somewhere to the north-west of this region across a sea. The threats and troubles of that area are not the concern of those living in this region for the most part, given the sea between them and the distances involved.
-Real world cultural analogs are Persia/Iran, Arabia, Byzantine Empire, the Caucuses people, Central Asia, and portions of the Indian subcontinent. This is an area of great trade routes.
-There are a combination of larger states mixed in with city-states and smaller powers that exist in a delicate balance of power. Trade binds them together, but the calculus could change.
-PCs are most likely going to be sellswords of some type or 'for hire' of another variety.
-Pit fighting is common in some parts of the world. Force labor of one variety or another does occur.

Initial City:
-Alkrash, The Gateway

Alkrash inhabits a unique intersection between the land across the Jeweled Sea and the people and lands of the continent of Marakan. It serves as a major conduit of trade between the peoples of the North and the peoples of Marakan with vast wealth flowing into its coffers from the revenue associated with such trade. Rulled by a Hakim (or king), the city-state is able to boast a well disciplined army consisting of professionals and mercenaries, never having to rely upon the levies that its nearest neigbors must rely upon for defense.

Though a city-state in name, Alkrash holds sway over several near by regions and colonies, making it the powerbroker of the region. Several islands in the Jeweled Sea are possessions of the Hakim while much of the Kursan River valley near the sea is in possession of the City-State as well. However, vast deserts and arid mountains extend the farther one goes from the coastline and much of it is beyond the control of Alkrash. Stories of ancient tomb complexes in the mountains are often swapped between the nomads who venture through the region along with stories of ancient undead wielding weapons and armor from a bygone age. Small villages are also nestled in the few areas with reliable water supplies, forming outposts amid the vast expanse of wilderness and desert. But this isn't even the 'true' desert to the nomads who inhabit the area.

If one was to travel south and east, one would run into the vast Desert of Souls, a barren region that rarely has any rainfall touch it. Here only the hardiest of nomadic people venture along with trade caravans seeking to trade via land with the Silver Coast on the East Coast of Marakan. There are a few settlements in the region, clustered around oasis and fortified against bandits, but many more oasis are the knowledge of only the nomads who venture through here, jealously guarded against all. They both act as caravan guides and raiders, switching between the two easily enough depending on the nature of those who seek to cross the great desert. Alkrash is the nexus of many of these roads, for to its west lay the rich trade routes and realms depeer into Marakan and beyond while to its North-East is the continent of Mundar with its many people and appetite for the goods that flow through Alkrash.

-Rule in Alkrash
Though Alkrash has a Hakim, the position is not inherited per say but elected after a period of consultation. The body is formed by a council of notables, mostly men and women who are well educated and/or are important members of society with an understanding of the needs of the community they are in. Once the Hakim is elected, he or she is given power to choose their ministers and to run the state, though always with a smaller body formed from the community to consult. This is not to say that this is fully democratic: the Hakim is still given great powers and more or less direct control of the colonies, but it does create a method of controlling the power and influence that the Hakim can gather to themselves.

Beneath the Hakim are the governors of various territories that Alkrash controls. The immediate environment around Alkrash itself is directly administered by the Hakim and their chosen advisers, while further afield governors are either appointed (if its strategically important to the whole) or locally elevated with approval from the Hakim. Consultation forms an important part of the governance in Alkrash, with the community always capable of giving a voice unless under two situations. The first is military affairs, for the Hakim needs to be certain that central administration of the mercenaries and men-at-arms under the City-States command is not comprormised. Second is on issues of trade. Alkrash depends heavily upon the trade that flows through its ports and along its roads, and thus consultation on that is more done through a much smaller body of the Merchant-Guilds.

-The City Itself
Alkrash is roughly divided in two: the old city surrounded by the curtain wall built by its old elites, and the new city that grew around it and has its own, newer wall to protect it. Beyond these two walls are the farmlands, townships, and villages that feed Alkrash and its residents. While Alkrash itself is cosmpolitan and wealthy, its surrounding areas are poorer in general with many of its people subsistence farmers working their plots of lands or indentured laborers working the large estates of wealthy land owners.

But within Alkrash itself there are more subdivisions of the city. The old city is divided into three parts: The Courtly Quarter, the Jada of the Gods, the Gilded Quarter, and the Artisans District. The Courtly quarter contains the Palace of the Hakim (called the Red Palace due to the material used to construct it), the various embassys of foreign powers, and the residents of various administrators of the state. The Hakims own guard, called the Sworn Swords, patrol the Courtly District and protect its residents. Order is maintained by them and they answer directly to the Hakim and the courts advisers.

The Jada of the Gods, also called the Avenue of Temples, is where the grand temples to the cities primary deities reside. Built at great expense through a combination of patronage from the cities wealthy and donations from its poor, the temples are the embodiments of the gods in the region. Within the gates of this Avenue no weapons are permitted except for those of the temple guards and of its priests, all others barred from threatening violence within. Even the Hakim and the Sworn Swords must give up their weapons at the gates, though this more ritual than an absolute rule.

The Gilded Quarter is where the wealthiest of the cities residents live. Oppulent mansions staffed by servnats cater to their needs while private guards hired by the residents of the district patrol the streets. The large land owners of the city often live here most of the year, though they attend to matters on their estates when the need arises. Merchants, though wealthy enough to live here, are often excluded and this is primarily the area where the old blood of the city lives.

Finally the artistan district serves the needs of the other three districts, producing fine goods for the consumption of the elite of the city. Fine works of art, jewelry, carvings, and the like are produced here by masters of their craft, though the intrigues of courtly life can see a man or woman fall from grace just as easily as they rise. The district is full of bustle and hustle as the artisans go about their daily work, often discussing the latest techniques or fighting for new contracts. It is whispered that sometimes a jealous artisan will hire an assassin to take down a rival, though none in the district would ever say such a thing.

Outside of the old city is the new city, itself relatively old by now. Here resides the major dockyards of the city with the merchants living close by to the warehouses and ships that earn their living. Called the Salt District due to the smell of the sea, the dockyards are busy throughout the day with ships coming and going constantly, transporting everything from bulk grain to fine silks from distant lands to precious metals mined from the lands across the sea. Like dockyards across the known world there is a seedy side to the place, with brothels and gambling dens and drug dens located throughout the warren of warehouses, tenements, and small businesses.

The Warrens is perhaps the most widely traversed by new comers to the city outside of the Salt District, for it is where the grand arenas are located. Here gladiatorial maches, races, and other performances are done infront of roaring crowds. Markets are also abundant in this district, with merchants and traders haggling and selling everything the city has to offer. One can make their fortune in such an area, or just as easily end up sold into slavery to settle ones debts.

Taking up much of the new city is the so called Stone District, for this is where the work force for the new walls was located during their construction. Here one can find the bulk of the cities population ranging from soldiers or sell swords to metal workers, carptenters, bread bakers, butchers, river dock workers, teamsters, and everyone else. Though foreigners don't frequent the Stone District, all know it it to be a place of intrigue for within the district are many secret societies dedicated to a variety of causes, whether it is to some forbidden power seeking to swallow the city in its embrace to political organizations seeking to elevate their own person to the throne to revolutionary ones that seek to install either a true Monarchy or tear the entire structure down. It is said that members of the Gilded District often send their agents here to recruit from the populace for their own schemes and plans while the street gangs that plague parts of the district are used as hired muscle by merchants to act in their interests.
