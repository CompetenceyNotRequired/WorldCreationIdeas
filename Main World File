Themes of the setting:
-The threats to the people and societies of the area come from mortal hands for the most part.
-Magic traditions vary, with the more scholarly wizard types in larger empires while sorcerers are the main source in city-states and outside of cities with institutes of magical learning.
-Sellswords and mercenaries are common and range from caravan guards to bandit killers to hardened professional soldiers.
-Civilization exists primarily near rivers, oceans, or areas of fresh water or good rainfall. Between these pockets of cities and farmland is the domain of nomads and merchant caravans along with hardy towns built near oasis or other fresh water supplies.
-Humanity in the region is diverse and culturally flourishing. Generally the major cities and trade hubs are cosmpolitan, though the further one goes away from them the more provincial the area becomes.
-The other ancestries also exist in the region, though to a greater or lesser extent depending on the region. This is to be determined.
-This ties into the other 'setting' of the world mostly via trade and diplomacy. The Great Confederation of Uldrath exists somewhere to the north-west of this region across a sea. The threats and troubles of that area are not the concern of those living in this region for the most part, given the sea between them and the distances involved.
-Real world cultural analogs are Persia/Iran, Arabia, Byzantine Empire, the Caucuses people, Central Asia, and portions of the Indian subcontinent. This is an area of great trade routes.
-There are a combination of larger states mixed in with city-states and smaller powers that exist in a delicate balance of power. Trade binds them together, but the calculus could change.
-PCs are most likely going to be sellswords of some type or 'for hire' of another variety.
-Pit fighting is common in some parts of the world. Force labor of one variety or another does occur.

Initial City:
-Alkrash, The Gateway

Alkrash inhabits a unique intersection between the land across the Jeweled Sea and the people and lands of the continent of Marakan. It serves as a major conduit of trade between the peoples of the North and the peoples of Marakan with vast wealth flowing into its coffers from the revenue associated with such trade. Rulled by a Hakim (or king), the city-state is able to boast a well disciplined army consisting of professionals and mercenaries, never having to rely upon the levies that its nearest neigbors must rely upon for defense. This wasn't always the case, for before the rise of the Hakim of Alkrash, the city had been rulled by a council of sorts consisting of
